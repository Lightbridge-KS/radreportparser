MRI AND MRA OF THE BRAIN  

HISTORY: Known case of ischemic stroke in a young patient with positive lupus anticoagulant, presented with right-sided hemiparesis for 12 hours. She was referred to rule out a small vessel infarction.  

TECHNIQUES:  
Sagittal SE T1W  
Axial SE T1W, TSE T2W FS, DWI with ADC mapping, SWI, T2W FLAIR  
Coronal GRE T2W  
TOF MRA of the brain and neck  

COMPARISON: CT of the brain 15/09/2019.  

FINDINGS:  
The study demonstrates normal gray-white matter differentiation in the brain parenchyma. The ventricular system and cortical sulci are within normal limits. The brainstem and cerebellum appear unremarkable.  

No evidence of acute infarction, recent intraparenchymal hemorrhage, extra-axial collection, hydrocephalus, or brain herniation.  

The calvarium and skull base show normal marrow signal intensity. A mucous retention cyst is noted in the left maxillary sinus. The orbits, other paranasal sinuses, and mastoid air cells appear within normal limits. No interval change in a small cyst at the left paramedian nasopharynx, likely a Thornwaldt cyst.  

The TOF MRA study demonstrates decreased flow-related enhancement at bilateral cavernous ICAs, which may represent an in-plane flow artifact. Hypoplasia of the A1 segment of the right ACA is observed as a normal anatomic variant. The remaining intracranial and cervical vessels show no significant stenosis, aneurysm, or vascular malformation.  

IMPRESSION:  
- No acute infarction detected.  
- Decreased flow-related enhancement at bilateral cavernous ICAs may be due to in-plane flow artifact.
