EMERGENCY MDCT OF THE BRAIN

HISTORY: A 25-year-old female presents with headache. Physical examination reveals no focal neurological deficits.

TECHNIQUE: Axial helical scan of the brain performed with coronal and sagittal reconstructions.

Comparison: None.

Findings:
The brain shows age-appropriate volume with normal parenchymal attenuation and gray-white differentiation. No acute infarction or hemorrhage identified. The ventricles are normal in size without intraventricular hemorrhage. No extra-axial collection, midline shift, or brain herniation. The vascular structures appear normal. The calvarium and skull base show no fracture. Visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoids, and upper cervical spine are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
- No intracranial hemorrhage, acute large territorial infarction, extra-axial collection, midline shift, brain herniation, or skull fracture identified.
