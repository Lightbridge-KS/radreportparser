MRI OF THE BRAIN  

History : A 35-year-old female with history of recurrent bilateral optic neuritis and a prior episode of transverse myelitis, tested negative for NMO IgG and oligoclonal bands, was referred for evaluation of the brain and spinal cord.  

Technique :  
Brain  
Sagittal MDEFT T1W, FLAIR FS + Gd with axial reconstruction  
Axial SE T1W, TSE T2WFS, DWI with ADC and EDC mapping, SWI, THRIVE + Gd with sagittal and coronal reconstruction  
Coronal FFE T2W  

Whole spine  
Sagittal T1W -/+ Gd, T2W, STIR  
Axial T1W -/+ Gd, TSE T2W, FFE T2W  
Coronal T2WFS  

Comparison : MRI of the brain and orbit dated 07/11/2018.  

Findings :  
Brain  
The current study demonstrates no significant change in the T2/FLAIR hyperintense foci at the splenium and body of the corpus callosum, extending into the callososeptal interface. No significant interval change in multiple hyperintense T2/FLAIR lesions involving bilateral thalami, centrum semiovale, and subcortical white matter of the bilateral frontal and parietal lobes. No new lesion is identified. Findings suggest stable disease in the context of an ongoing demyelinating process. The remainder of the brain parenchyma and ventricular system appear within normal limits. No T1 hypointensity or abnormal post-contrast enhancement is observed. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, acute infarction, midline shift, hydrocephalus, extra-axial collection, or brain herniation.  

Whole spine  
The study reveals a mild T2 hyperintense signal involving a substantial cross-section of the spinal cord. The full extent of the lesion is difficult to delineate, but grossly, it spans a long segment, nearly the entire spinal cord.  
Vertebral marrow signal appears within normal limits.  
The conus medullaris terminates at the L1-2 level and exhibits normal morphology.  
The cauda equina nerve roots are symmetrically arranged.  
No abnormal enhancement or leptomeningeal enhancement is detected.  

Impression :  
Stable intracranial lesions with extensive longitudinal spinal cord involvement, suggestive of a demyelinating process, with findings favoring NMO over MS.
