**EMERGENCY MDCT OF THE BRAIN**

**HISTORY:** A 25-year-old female presents with dizziness and brief loss of consciousness following a minor head impact 3 hours ago. Physical examination reveals no focal neurological deficits. The CT scan was requested to rule out intracranial hemorrhage.

**TECHNIQUES:** Axial helical scan of the brain was performed using 2.5-mm (brain) and 1.25-mm (bone) slice thickness with coronal and sagittal reconstructions.  

**COMPARISON:** None.

**FINDINGS:**

**Cerebral parenchyma:** The study reveals age-appropriate brain volume. Normal parenchymal attenuation and gray-white differentiation. The remainder of the imaged cerebral parenchyma appears unremarkable. No acute large territorial infarction or intraparenchymal hemorrhage is identified.

**Cerebellum and posterior fossa:** Normal, with a limited evaluation of the brainstem due to beam-hardening artifacts. The cerebellum appears unremarkable.

**Extraaxial spaces:** No extra-axial collection is observed.

**Ventricles:** Normal size of the ventricular system. No intraventricular hemorrhage.

**Midline shift:** None.

**Brain herniation:** None.

**Vascular system:** Normal.

**Calvarium and scalp:** No fracture identified.

**Skull base, sella and temporomandibular joints (TMJs):** Normal.

**Visualized orbits, paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells:** Mild mucosal thickening in the right nasal cavity and bilateral maxillary sinuses. The remainder of the visualized orbits, mastoid air cells, and nasopharynx appear unremarkable.

**Visualized upper cervical spine:** No fracture identified.

**IMPRESSION:**
- No intracranial hemorrhage, acute large territorial infarction, extra-axial collection, midline shift, brain herniation, or skull fracture identified.
