**MDCT OF THE BRAIN, CHEST AND WHOLE ABDOMEN (1st study, baseline scan)**   

   

**HISTORY:** 
A 68-year-old man, known history of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung
S/P left upper lobectomy, was referred for pre-treatment evaluation (trial PD-001).    

**Technique:** 
Axial scans of the brain, chest, and whole abdomen were performed with IV
contrast material as per standard departmental protocol.    

    

**CT BRAIN**    

**COMPARISON:**
 None.   

**FINDINGS:**    

      
The study shows normal brain parenchymal attenuation.    

No evidence of focal mass or significant leptomeningeal enhancement. No large
infarction, acute intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial collection, hydrocephalus, or brain herniation.    

Mild atherosclerosis of bilateral cavernous ICAs is noted. The
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, orbits, and bony structures appear unremarkable.   

    

**CT OF THE CHEST AND WHOLE ABDOMEN**    

   

**COMPARISON:** 
Previous CT of the chest and upper abdomen performed on 14/05/2021.
  

**FINDINGS:**    

**Tube and line:** 
None.    

**Lungs and airways:**
 Post left upper lobectomy with interval progression in size of
an irregular enhancing soft tissue mass at the LLL near the bronchial stump, now measuring approximately
1.8x2.5 cm from 1.6x2.1 cm in transaxial dimension. The mass encroaches upon the LLL bronchus, leading to
partial collapse.    

Multiple peribronchial nodules and part-solid masses with irregular
margins at the left lower lobe have increased in size, the largest now measuring 3.5x4.8 cm (Im 64, Se 302).
Two additional dominant nodules in the left lower lobe measure 2.9 cm (Im 89, Se 302; target lesion#1) and
3.3 cm (Im 104, Se 302; target lesion#2).    

A tiny stable ground-glass nodule at the apicoposterior segment of the RUL
(4 mm, Im 42, Se302). No significant fibrosis in bilateral lower lobes.   

**Pleura:**
 Enlargement of a nodular pleural thickening along the left 6th-7th
posterior costal pleura, now measuring up to 1.7x3.5 cm (Im 72, Se701). Small left-sided pleural effusion is
present. No pneumothorax.    

**Mediastinum:** 
No significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Normal heart
size without pericardial effusion. No abnormality of visualized thoracic aorta or esophagus.    

**Target lesions**    

1. A pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe, size = 2.9 cm (Im 89, Se 302; target lesion#1)    

2. A pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe, size = 3.3 cm (Im 104, Se 302; target lesion#2)   
   

**Sum of longest diameter of target lesions = 6.2 cm = 62 mm**
   

**Evaluation of target lesions = Baseline study**    

  

**IMPRESSION:**    

**BRAIN**    

- Unremarkable brain CT.    

    

**CHEST, AND WHOLE ABDOMEN**    

 - Status post left upper lobectomy with interval increase in the size of the
soft tissue at the LLL near the surgical site, leading to partial collapse. 
**Findings concerning for progression of recurrent lung cancer.**    

 **- Suggestive of worsening pulmonary metastases in the left lung.**    

 - Stable ground-glass nodule at the RUL, indeterminate etiology,
follow-up recommended.   

 - Increasing thickness of pleural nodularity along the left 6th-7th ribs,
possible progressive pleural metastasis. Follow-up advised.
