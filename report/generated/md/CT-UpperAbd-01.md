**EMERGENCY MDCT SCAN OF THE UPPER ABDOMEN**

**HISTORY:** Known case of HTN and dyslipidemia, presented with epigastric pain and fever for two days. He was sent for rule out acute cholecystitis.  
**TECHNIQUES:** Axial helical scan of the upper abdomen with 3-mm slice thickness.  
**The scan phases included:** plain, late arterial, portovenous, and delayed 3-minute (liver).  
Intravenous contrast brand, concentration, volume: Visipaque320; 70 ml.  
**Other route(s) of contrast:** Oral (limited water)  
**Fasting (NPO) time:** N/A  
**Immediate complication:** none.  
**Estimated radiation dose:** 9.2154 mGy, 1085.42 mGycm. Standard DRL recommended by the American College of Radiology and European Commission = 25 mGy, 900 mGycm. Values reported for 16-32-cm PMMA phantom. Uncertainties associated with this method are approximately 20%. Size-dependent factors have not been incorporated.  

**COMPARISON:** US of the upper abdomen dated 05/08/2024.  

**FINDINGS:**  
**Lower thorax:** Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. No mass, consolidation, or tree-in-bud opacity. Normal heart size without pericardial effusion.  
**Liver, hepatic vasculature, bile ducts, and gallbladder:**  
- Mildly distended gallbladder containing a few small gallstones (up to 4 mm) at the gallbladder neck, with mild gallbladder wall thickening (about 3 mm), slight pericholecystic fat stranding, and subtle surrounding hyperemia. No pericholecystic fluid collection.  
- Mildly prominent CBD (up to 8 mm) with mild bile duct wall thickening and enhancement of the CBD and intrahepatic ducts. No radiopaque bile duct stone.  
- Diffuse hepatic steatosis without focal hepatic lesion. Patent IVC, hepatic veins, and portal veins.  
**Pancreas:** No focal pancreatic lesion or ductal dilatation.  
**Spleen:** Normal size. No focal lesions.  
**Adrenals:** No adrenal nodules.  
**Kidneys and proximal ureters:** Normal size, parenchymal enhancement, and excretory function of both kidneys. No significant change of a 2.4-cm lobulated cortical cyst with thin internal septations at the mid-pole of the left kidney. No stones, hydronephrosis, or mass.  
**Bowel and mesentery:** Few small diverticula in the sigmoid colon without surrounding fat stranding. No bowel distension or wall thickening.  
**Lymph nodes:** Multiple small periportal, paracaval, and aortocaval lymph nodes, the largest measuring 0.9 cm in short-axis diameter, likely reactive.  
**Peritoneum, retroperitoneum, and abdominal wall:** No free fluid or free air.  
**Vessels:** A 1.4-cm saccular aneurysm with a partially thrombosed and calcified wall arising from the proximal left renal artery. Mild atherosclerotic changes of the abdominal aorta and its major branches.  
**Bony structures:** Mild osteopenia. Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bone lesions.  

**IMPRESSION:**  
- Small gallstones at the gallbladder neck with mild gallbladder wall thickening and mild pericholecystic fat stranding; findings suggestive of early acute calculous cholecystitis.  
- Mild bile duct wall enhancement along the CBD and intrahepatic bile ducts; possible early acute cholangitis.  
- Mild prominence of the CBD without an obvious obstructive lesion.  
- Few colonic diverticula without signs of acute diverticulitis.  
- No significant change in a 2.4-cm lobulated cortical cyst with thin internal septations at the left kidney (Bosniak II).  
- A 1.4-cm saccular aneurysm with partial thrombosis and calcification arising from the proximal left renal artery.
