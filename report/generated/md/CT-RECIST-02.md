**MDCT OF THE CHEST AND WHOLE ABDOMEN (2nd study, 1st follow-up scan)**   

   

**HISTORY:** 
A 69-year-old man, known history of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma
S/P left upper lobectomy, was referred for follow-up evaluation during clinical trial protocol PD-001.    

**Technique:**
 Axial scans of the brain, chest, and whole abdomen were performed with IV
contrast material as per standard departmental protocol.    

**COMPARISON:**
 Prior baseline CT chest and whole abdomen obtained on 05/08/2023.
  
   

**FINDINGS:**    

**Tube and line:**
 None.    

**Lungs and airways:** 
 Post left upper lobectomy with no significant interval change in the
heterogeneous enhancing soft tissue mass at the LLL near the bronchial stump, now measuring 1.7x2.4 cm
in transaxial dimension. The soft tissue mass involves the LLL bronchus, leading to partial collapse.
   

      
There is a slight reduction in size of multiple peribronchial part-solid nodules and masses with irregular
margins in the LLL, with target lesion#1 decreasing from 2.65 cm to 2.38 cm in the greatest transaxial diameter
(target#1; Im 78 Se 210), and target lesion#2 decreasing from 3.10 cm to 2.91 cm (target#2; Im 92 Se 210).
The largest lesion with pleural attachment and adjacent subsegmental atelectasis in the superior segment of
the LLL has decreased from 3.5x4.6 cm to 3.3x3.8 cm (Im 58 Se 210).    

      
However, there is a mild increase in size of a part-solid nodule in the superior segment of the LLL
(Im 59 Se 210) from 0.70 cm to 1.15 cm. No significant interval change of a tiny ground-glass nodule in the
apicoposterior segment of the RUL. No interval change in fibrosis at bilateral lower lobes and inferior
lingular segment of the LUL.    

**Pleura:**
 No significant change in the nodular pleural thickening along the left
6th-7th posterior costal pleura, now measuring up to 1.4x3.3 cm (Im 58, Se 602). Small left-sided pleural
effusion persists. No pneumothorax.    

**Mediastinum:** 
 No significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Normal heart
size without pericardial effusion. No abnormalities in visualized thoracic aorta or esophagus.    

**Target lesions**    

 1. Slight decrease in size of the pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe,
now 2.38 cm from 2.65 cm (Im 78 Se 210; target lesion#1).    

 2. Slight decrease in size of the pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe,
now 2.91 cm from 3.10 cm (Im 92 Se 210; target lesion#2).    

    

 Sum of longest diameter of target lesions = 5.29 cm = 52.9 mm from
baseline 57.5 mm (8% decrease in SLD of the two target lesions).    

 **Evaluation of target lesions = Stable disease**    

  

**IMPRESSION:**    

 - Status post left upper lobectomy with stable soft tissue mass at the
LLL near the surgical site, leading to partial collapse. Findings remain concerning for persistent/recurrent
lung cancer.    

 - Slight regression of multiple metastatic pulmonary masses in the left
lung.    

 - Increase in size of a 1.15-cm part-solid nodule in the LLL,
uncertain nature, and possibly representing progressive pulmonary metastasis or an emerging primary tumor.
Close follow-up is advised.    

 - No significant change in a tiny ground-glass nodule in the RUL,
indeterminate significance. Surveillance recommended.    

 - No interval change in nodular pleural thickening along the left 6th-7th
ribs, possibly representing pleural metastasis or post-surgical scarring. Follow-up suggested.    

 - No intra-thoracic or upper abdominal lymphadenopathy.    

 - No interval change in a small hepatic cyst, renal cysts, or bilateral
renal AMLs.    

 - No interval change in multiple small hypodense thyroid nodules.
