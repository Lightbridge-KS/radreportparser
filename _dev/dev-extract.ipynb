Extension of the lesion is described as follow;  ... Superior: No interval change of extension into the left foramen Ovale and left inferior orbital fissure. No significant change of few enhancing foci in the left inferior temporal lobe.  ... Anterior: Involvement of the left infratemporal fossa, left PPF, left retroantral space, and left masticator space. Erosion and sclerotic change of the left pterygoid bone and posterior wall of the left maxillary sinus, unchanged.\n",
