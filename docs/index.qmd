**Parse and extract key sections from radiology reports text**
:::

`radreportparser` is a Python package that helps you extract structured information from free-text radiology reports using regular expressions.

::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
This package is in early development phase and subject to change.

## Features

-   üìã Extract common radiology report sections [^1]
    -   Included: Title, History, Technique, Comparison, Findings, and Impression
-   üîç Flexible pattern matching with customizable section markers
-   üîÑ Convert extracted sections to Python dictionaries or JSON

[^1]: The "common" radiology report section were based on author experience in our institution. 

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub:

``` bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/Lightbridge-KS/radreportparser
```

## Quick Start

### Extract Report

Here's a simple example of extracting sections from a radiology report:

```{python}
from radreportparser import RadReportExtractor

# Sample brain CT report (note the markdown formatting)
report_text = """
EMERGENCY MDCT OF THE BRAIN

**HISTORY:** A 25-year-old female presents with headache. Physical examination reveals no focal neurological deficits.

TECHNIQUE: Axial helical scan of the brain performed with coronal and sagittal reconstructions.

*Comparison:* None.

Findings:

The brain shows age-appropriate volume with normal parenchymal attenuation and gray-white differentiation. No acute infarction or hemorrhage identified. The ventricles are normal in size without intraventricular hemorrhage. No extra-axial collection, midline shift, or brain herniation. The vascular structures appear normal. The calvarium and skull base show no fracture. Visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoids, and upper cervical spine are unremarkable.

=== IMPRESSION ===

- No intracranial hemorrhage, acute large territorial infarction, extra-axial collection, midline shift, brain herniation, or skull fracture identified.
"""

# Initialize extractor and parse the report
extractor = RadReportExtractor()
report = extractor.extract_all(report_text)
report
```

**Access individual sections:**

```{python}
print(report.history)
```

### Convert to dictionary or JSON

```{python}
report.to_dict()
```

```{python}
print(report.to_json(indent = 2)) # pretty-printed
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="default" collapse="false"}
The pattern matching mechanism can extract sections from text with plain text or markdown formatting.
