The goal of `radreportparser` is to extract text section from free-text radiology report using pattern regcognition based on regular expression. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/Lightbridge-KS/radreportparser) with:

```python
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/Lightbridge-KS/radreportparser
```


## Usage


```{python}
report_text = """
EMERGENCY MDCT OF THE BRAIN

**HISTORY:** A 25-year-old female presents with headache. Physical examination reveals no focal neurological deficits.

TECHNIQUE: Axial helical scan of the brain performed with coronal and sagittal reconstructions.

*Comparison:* None.

**Findings:**
The brain shows age-appropriate volume with normal parenchymal attenuation and gray-white differentiation. No acute infarction or hemorrhage identified. The ventricles are normal in size without intraventricular hemorrhage. No extra-axial collection, midline shift, or brain herniation. The vascular structures appear normal. The calvarium and skull base show no fracture. Visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoids, and upper cervical spine are unremarkable.

**IMPRESSION**:
- No intracranial hemorrhage, acute large territorial infarction, extra-axial collection, midline shift, brain herniation, or skull fracture identified.

```

### Extract All

Extract text section in radiology report and represented it in `RadReport()` object.

```{python}
from radreportparser import RadReportExtractor

# Initilize the extractor with default config
rre = RadReportExtractor()

# Extract All Filds
report = rre.extract_all(report_text)
report
```

**Get text by sections:**

```{python}
# Get "history" section
report.history
```


### Convert to Dictionary & JSON

```{python}
report.to_dict()
```


```{python}
report.to_json()
```
